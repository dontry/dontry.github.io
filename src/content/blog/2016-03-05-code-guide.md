 Recently I got a job as a front-end developer. It's very interesting and exciting. But working in a group is different from working individually. Currently, we are working on a project of developing an online course platform. It's a big project. The programs are intricate and complex. Thus it's very crucial for us to write readable, flexible and maintainable code. This is so true especially for front-end developers Because you work across different languages: html, css, javascript. If you don't write consistently with certain code style, it will be a nightmare as the project grows bigger.  Therefore, a code guide is essential. Here are some codeÔºèstyle guide:
